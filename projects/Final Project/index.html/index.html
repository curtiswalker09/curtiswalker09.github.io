    <h1>Review of Maryland</h1>
    <p>University of Maryland football team won the Pinstripe bowl in 2021. Their first bowl win since 2010. UMD
        finished the season with a record of 7-6, their first positive record since 2014. UMD left the ACC and joined
        the Big Ten in 2014 and it has been tough to find any success in the Big Ten. Since 2000 UMD has had a positive
        record in the ACC seven times with a high of 11 wins. In the Big Ten UMD has only had a positive record twice
        with a high of seven wins. Despite that after this latest season the perception of UMD football is head coach
        Mike Locksley will bring UMD to new heights. I had the pleasure of talking with University of Maryland tight end
        Malik Jackson about what Locksley has done to change the program.
    </p>

    <h2>Players Thoughts</h2>
    <p>Here are some things Jackson had to say. “He has created like a different environment from how it used to be…he
        put a big emphasis on mental health and creating like an open door policy making the program family orientated.”
        Jackson also mentioned “He is a players coach real relatable I think a lot of people will say about him, me
        being from the area..just having a coach that looks like me we went through some of the similar things, so he is
        real relatable and everyone gets along with him.” Former Maryland Head Coach D.J. Durkin had an ugly breakup
        from Maryland, so Locksley had a tough task to get Maryland football back on track. In order to change a culture
        attitude must change and it seems like Locksley is doing just that. </p>


    <h3>A Deeper Dive into Maryland</h3>
    <p>Alright now it is time to dig deep into UMD football for the last ten years. Since 2012 the most consecutive
        positive seasons UMD has had is two. Those were the 2013 and 2014 seasons. It will be interesting to see if
        Locksley can change that trend and string a lot of positive seasons. In the three seasons Locksley has been the
        head coach at Maryland he has had a record of 3-9, 2-3, and 7-6. He has shown steady improvement each season.
        Since 2013 UMD average recruiting classes have been the 33.9 best with the high being the 18th ranked class.
        Since Locksley has gotten there the average recruiting class has been the 31st best with the high being the 19th
        ranked class. Recruiting is the most important aspect for a coach in college football. If you can not recruit
        you will not be successful as a head coach. The perception of UMD football under Locksley is that recruiting has
        gotten better and Maryland is keeping more in-state talent which was a problem under the previous UMD head
        coaches. Perception is not reality unfortunately. UMD recruiting has shown minimal improvement as the numbers
        prove. To be fair recruiting is always the hardest part to improve when you are a new head coach. Since 2019 UMD
        has finished 10th, 8th, and 10th in the big ten. Locksley has not lived up to big expectations yet. UMD at its
        best is a middle of the road team, therefore the expectations for Locksley is to finish around 5th and 6th
        place. It is a tough task in a tough conference like the Big Ten but UMD athletic director believes Locksley can
        fulfill those expectations.
