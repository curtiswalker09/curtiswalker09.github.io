        <p>Cal Ripken Jr. doesn’t listen to rap, but rappers know Cal Ripken.</p>

        <p>Known as the Iron Man for his record 2,632 consecutive game streak playing for the Baltimore Orioles,
        Ripken is
        now retired and living in Annapolis. But with 17 years out of the game and nearly a quarter century
        since his
        streak ended, his streak of hip-hop references is still going strong.</p>
        
        <p>The baseball legend has been mentioned in some shape or form in more than 50 rap songs since 1998 and as
        recently
        as this fall.

        <p>Ripken said he’s more of a country fan, but credits the relatability of his record for making him a rap
            legend.</p>
            
        <p>“I’m amazed how many people relate to the streak. It wasn’t about breaking Lou Gehrig's record. It was
        about values,” Ripken said. “I’ve heard people’s stories from being in the factory every day to teachers
        in the classroom.”</p>
        
        <p>For rappers like <span class="name">A$AP Ant</span>, the Baltimore-bred former A$AP Mob member, Ripken
        brings a dose of nostalgia into his music.</p>
        
        <p>“I grew up watching baseball. Cal Ripken was ... like a Baltimore hero. Like how Ray Lewis is,” he said.
        “That’s the one thing that we got. When people don’t know Baltimore for nothing, they know Baltimore for
        Cal Ripken. Kids looked up to him and wanted to be him.”</p>
        
        <p>Ant is one of the most recent rappers to feature Cal in his lyrics and the artwork for his single. Below,
        check out his song and the rest of Cal Ripken’s rap history.</p>

            <p>Ripken broke Gehrig’s record on Sept. 6, 1995, but it wasn’t until 1998 when he had already
            surpassed the
            record by 502 games, that he decided to end the streak. It was also this year that rap legends
            began to

            <p>The late <span class="name">Phife Dawg</span> was Ripken’s biggest fan of this era, comparing
            himself to
            the Iron Man in two different songs. <span class="name">Lil Wayne</span> would go on to reuse
            his Ripken
            line in the song “BM J.R.” from his 2004 album “Tha Carter.”</p>
