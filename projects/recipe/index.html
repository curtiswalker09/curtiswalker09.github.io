    <h1>Salmon with Lentils, Bacon, and Olives</h1>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>4 six ounce portions of salmon. 1/2 cup pitted and chopped Gordal olives (or any mild green olive such as
        Castelvetrano). 2 cups precooked Du Puy lentils. 1/2 cup chicken stock, preferably home made. 1/4 cup minced
        shallots. 1/4 minced carrots. 1/4 cup minced leeks. 1/2 cup finely diced bacon. 1/8 cup minced chives. 1 lemon.
        Olive oil. Salt and pepper</p>
    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <p>To make lentils: Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in a high-sided pot over medium heat. Add the bacon, shallots, carrots,
        and leeks. Cook until some of the fat from the bacon has rendered and the bacon is starting to get crispy. Add
        the lentils and chicken stock, bring to a boil and add salt and pepper if needed. Once seasoning is adjusted,
        add Gordal olives and chives and keep warm until ready to serve.</p>
    <p>To cook the salmon: Season the salmon with salt and pepper. Heat a large saute pan over medium high heat and add
        about 1/4 cup olive oil. When very hot, add the salmon and cook until both sides are golden brown, about 3-4
        minutes per side. Set aside on paper towels to absorb any excessive oil.</p>
    <p>Divide the warm lentils between four warm plates. Place a piece of salmon on each plate, squeeze a little lemon
        on each piece of fish and serve while hot.</p>
