    <h4 class="headers">Childhood</h4>
    <p>Earhart was the daughter of Samuel "Edwin" Stanton Earhart (1867-1930) and Amelia "Amy" (née Otis;
        (1869-1962).[13] She was born in Atchison, Kansas, in the home of her maternal grandfather, Alfred Gideon Otis
        (1827-1912), who was a former federal judge, the president of the Atchison Savings Bank and a leading citizen in
        the town. Amelia was the second child of the marriage after an infant was stillborn in August 1896.[14] She was
        of part German descent. Alfred Otis had not initially favored the marriage and was not satisfied with Edwin's
        progress as a lawyer.[15]</p>
    <br>
    <h4 class="headers">Marriage</h4>
    <p>Earhart was engaged to Samuel Chapman, a chemical engineer from Boston; she broke off the engagement on November
        23, 1928.[87] During the same period, Earhart and publisher George P. Putnam had spent a great deal of time
        together. Putnam, who was known as GP, was divorced in 1929 and sought out Earhart, proposing to her six times
        before she finally agreed to marry him.[Note 8] They married on February 7, 1931, in Putnam's mother's house in
        Noank, Connecticut. Earhart referred to her marriage as a "partnership" with "dual control". In a letter written
        to Putnam and hand-delivered to him on the day of the wedding, she wrote, "I want you to understand I shall not
        hold you to any midaevil [sic] code of faithfulness to me nor shall I consider myself bound to you similarly."
        She continued, "I may have to keep some place where I can go to be by myself, now and then, for I cannot
        guarantee to endure at all times the confinement of even an attractive cage."[Note 9][90][91]</p>
    <br>
    <h4 class="headers">Planning world flight</h4>
    <p>The original plan was a two-person crew. Earhart would fly and Manning would navigate. During a flight across the
        country that included Earhart, Manning, and Putnam, Earhart flew using landmarks. She and Putnam knew where they
        were. Manning did a navigation fix, but that fix alarmed Putnam, because Manning's position put them in the
        wrong state. They were flying close to the state line, so the navigation error was minor, but Putnam was still
        concerned.[126] Sometime later, Putnam and Mantz arranged a night flight to test Manning's navigational
        skill.[127] Under poor navigational conditions, Manning's position was off by 20 miles. Elgen M. and Marie K.
        Long consider Manning's performance reasonable because it was within an acceptable error of 30 miles, but Mantz
        and Putnam wanted a better navigator.[128]</p>
