            <h2>Job Details</h2>
            <p>You must create a website that will mainly provide information. The goal is to make the website easy to
                navigate. Besides the landing page, the website will need a about page, product pages and a privacy
                policy page. The landing page should have a Contact Us section. There should be a call to action to get
                users to order a free sample. They would prefer a minimal design, and would like you to use the brand
                color, which is orange. Take into account the client's preferences and values.</p>
